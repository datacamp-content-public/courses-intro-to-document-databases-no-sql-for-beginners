In this lesson we are going to learn how data is stored in MongoDB and how can we interact with it.

## What is MongoDB?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5f91950b60"
```

`@part1`
- Open-source document database

- High performance

- High availability

- Automatic scaling


`@script`
MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.

## Data storage

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "b76580b637"
```

`@part1`
- Documents BSON format (records)
- Collections (tables)

{
    name: "Miriam",
    age: 34,
    job: "Software engineer",
    hobbies: ["hiking", "reading"]
}


`@script`
In MongoDB data is stored in Documents, just as Records in Relational Databases. The structure is a JSON document binary-encoded format called BSON.

Documents are stored in collections, which are analogous to tables in Relational Databases.

Here we have an example of a Document:
{
    name: "Miriam",
    age: 34,
    job: "Software engineer",
    hobbies: ["hiking", "reading"]
}
