## Introduction to MongoDB

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "88d1de21fb"
```

`@lower_third`

name: Miriam Antona
title: Software engineer


`@script`
In this lesson we are going to learn how data is stored in MongoDB and how can we interact with it.

## What is MongoDB?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5f91950b60"
```

`@part1`
- Open-source document database

- High performance

- High availability

- Automatic scaling


`@script`
MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.

## Data storage

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "b76580b637"
```

`@part1`
- Documents BSON format (records)
- Collections (tables)


```
{
    name: "Miriam",
    age: 34,
    job: "Software engineer",
    hobbies: ["hiking", "reading"]
}
```


`@script`
In MongoDB data is stored in Documents, just as Records in Relational Databases. The structure is a JSON document binary-encoded format called BSON.

Documents are stored in collections, which are analogous to tables in Relational Databases.

Here we have an example of a Document:
{
    name: "Miriam",
    age: 34,
    job: "Software engineer",
    hobbies: ["hiking", "reading"]
}

## Insert data (simple insertion)

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "af80328f7c"
```

`@part1`
- insertOne()


```
db.workers.insertOne(
		{name: "David", age: "24", job: "Consultant"}
	)
```


`@script`
In MongoDB we can insert a single document into a collection with the method insertOne()

The following example inserts one worker in workers collection:

	**db.workers.insertOne(
		{name: "David", age: "24", job: "Consultant"}
	)**

This method returns a document which has a new document's _id field value. It is like a primary key.
If the collection does not exist, MongoDB will create it.


---
## Insert data (multiple insertion)

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "59d4ba5127"
```

`@part1`
- insertMany()

```
db.workers.insertMany([
   {name: "David", age: "24", job: "Consultant"},
   {name: "Ruben", age: "28", job: "Marketing"},
   {name: "Emma", age: "41", job: "Manager"}
])
```


`@script`
We can also insert multiple documents into a collection with insertMany() method, passing an array of documents.
Here we have an example of it:

db.workers.insertMany([
   {name: "David", age: "24", job: "Consultant"},
   {name: "Ruben", age: "28", job: "Marketing"},
   {name: "Emma", age: "41", job: "Manager"}
])

This method returns a document which has the new document's _id field value.


---
## Query documents

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "9d281c165a"
```

`@part1`
- find()

```
db.workers.find({})
```
```
db.workers.find({job: "Manager"})
```


`@script`
We can retrieve the inserted documents with the method find()
In the following example all the workers will be listed:

db.workers.find({})


We can retrieve filter documents creating query filters. 
For example, if we want to select from the workers collection all whose job is Manager:

db.workers.find({job: "Manager"})

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "82044c1fa2"
```
